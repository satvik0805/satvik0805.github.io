I am a goal-oriented, determined, hard-working Junior Undergraduate at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, India, pursuing my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. Equipped with technical, analytical, and leadership skills, I'm deeply interested in the field of Robotics and Automation with a demonstrated history in Computer-Aided Design, Control Systems, Rapid Prototyping, and Manufacturing. I believe in learning by doing things. My goal is to take my skills and channel them into a career where I can join my fellow researchers, innovators, engineers to make robots (of any type/any kind) accessible to all by inventing unique solutions for real-world problems. I believe my skills, creativity, and enthusiasm for the field will be assets to any team I join.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
