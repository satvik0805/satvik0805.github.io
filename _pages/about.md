I am a Senior Undergraduate student at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, India majoring in Mechanical Engineering and working in the exciting field of **Robotics & Automation**. In the past few years I have worked on multiple projects including development of autonomous mobile robots, robotic mobile manipulators, machine learning, computer vision, and designing & controlling of various automated/robotic systems.

During my school days I had the oppurtunity to participate and represent India at the <a href="http://2016.robocup.org/web/index-2.html">International RoboCup Junior</a> held in Leipzig, Germany in the year 2016. During my time at Thapar Institute, I have been working on various academic and research projects. I also had the oppurtunity to intern at **Larsen & Toubro, Heavy Engineering Division** situated on the west coast of India, in the city of Hazira. As part of compulsory project semester training in my Junior year I had the privilege of working under the guidance of <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/ang-jr-marcelo-h/">Prof. Marcelo H Ang</a> in his research group at the <a href="https://arc.nus.edu.sg/">Advanced Robotics Centre</a>, **National Univeristy of Singapore**.

Prior to my internship in National University of Singapore I was and currently a part of <a href="https://med.thapar.edu/facultydetails/MTE1NQ==">Prof. T.K. Bera's</a> systems and controls research group and <a href="https://med.thapar.edu/facultydetails/MTE5NQ==">Dr. Vishal Gupta's</a> innovative additive manufacturing team at Thapar Institute.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, while staying in the lockdown period at homes, I co-founded <a href="https://sites.google.com/thapar.edu/echoestiet/home?authuser=0">Echoes - The Student's Panorama of TIET</a>, the official broadcast media house of Thapar Institute. ECHOES produces the official student magazine of the institution, capturing, rejoicing and celebrating university life in all its diverse glamour. I have also been involved with the community serving

<!-- I am a goal-oriented, determined, hard-working Junior Undergraduate at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, India, pursuing my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. Equipped with technical, analytical, and leadership skills, I'm deeply interested in the field of Robotics and Automation with a demonstrated history in Computer-Aided Design, Control Systems, Rapid Prototyping, and Manufacturing. I believe in learning by doing things. My goal is to take my skills and channel them into a career where I can join my fellow researchers, innovators, engineers to make robots (of any type/any kind) accessible to all by inventing unique solutions for real-world problems. I believe my skills, creativity, and enthusiasm for the field will be assets to any team I join. -->
