I am a Senior Undergraduate student at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, India majoring in Mechanical Engineering and working in the exciting field of **Robotics & Automation**. In the past few years I have worked on multiple projects including development of autonomous mobile robots, robotic mobile manipulators, machine learning, computer vision, and designing & controlling of various automated/robotic systems.

During my school days I had the oppurtunity to participate and represent India at the **International RoboCup Junior held in Leipzig, Germany** in the year 2016. During my time at Thapar Institute, I have been working on various academic and research projects. I also had the oppurtunity to intern at **Larsen & Toubro, Heavy Engineering Division** situated on the west coast of India, in the city of Hazira. As part of compulsory project semester training in my Junior year I had the privilege of working under the guidance of Prof. Marcelo H Ang in his research group at the **Advanced Robotics Centre, National Univeristy of Singapore**.

Prior to my internship in National University of Singapore I was a part of Prof. T.K. Bera's systems and controls research group and Dr. Vishal Gupta's innovative additive manufacturing team at Thapar Institute.

Bored of staying at home during the COVID pandemic, I co-founded **Echoes - The Student's Panorama of TIET**, the official broadcast media house of Thapar Institute. ECHOES produces the official student magazine of the institution, capturing, rejoicing and celebrating university life in all its diverse glamour. I have also been involved with the community serving

<!-- I am a goal-oriented, determined, hard-working Junior Undergraduate at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, India, pursuing my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. Equipped with technical, analytical, and leadership skills, I'm deeply interested in the field of Robotics and Automation with a demonstrated history in Computer-Aided Design, Control Systems, Rapid Prototyping, and Manufacturing. I believe in learning by doing things. My goal is to take my skills and channel them into a career where I can join my fellow researchers, innovators, engineers to make robots (of any type/any kind) accessible to all by inventing unique solutions for real-world problems. I believe my skills, creativity, and enthusiasm for the field will be assets to any team I join. -->
