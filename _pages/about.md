Hello, thanks for visiting my portfolio website.

<br>
I am a Graduate Student at <strong><a href= "https://www.ntu.edu.sg/"> <b>NTU, Singapore,</b></a></strong> pursuing a master's degree in Smart Manufacturing with a focus on human-robot collaboration. My research work, advised by <strong><b><a href="https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00604">Prof. Domenico Campolo</a></b></strong>, is focused on developing control algorithms for dual-arm manipulation of boxes using the Superquadrics approach.

<br><br>
My research interests primarily revolve around the convergence of robotics and manufacturing. I am enthusiastic about exploring and advancing the capabilities of collaborative robots to address the challenges faced by humans in factory environments, ultimately making factories more intelligent and efficient in their production processes with the use of cobots.

<br><br>
I graduated from Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, India, with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and have been working in the field of <strong>Robotics & Automation</strong>. Over the past few years, I have been involved in a variety of projects, including the development of autonomous mobile robots, robotic mobile manipulators, application of machine learning and computer vision algorithms on the design and control of various automated/robotic systems.

<br><br>
During my time at Thapar Institute, I have also been actively involved in various academic and research projects, including internships at <strong>L&T, Heavy Engineering Division</strong> and the <strong>National University of Singapore</strong>. I joined as a research intern, advised by<strong><a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/ang-jr-marcelo-h/"> Prof. Marcelo H. Ang</a></strong> in his research group at the <strong><a href="https://arc.nus.edu.sg/">Advanced Robotics Centre, NUS</a></strong> from January to June 2022.

<br><br>
Apart from my academic pursuits, I have had the opportunity to participate in a noteworthy events and experiences. Back in high school, I had the honor of representing India at the <strong><a href="http://2016.robocup.org/web/index-2.html">International RoboCup Junior</a></strong>, held in <strong>Leipzig, Germany</strong> in 2016.

<!-- <br><br>
Moreover, I have also been involved in research projects at Thapar Institute, with  <a href="https://med.thapar.edu/facultydetails/MTE1NQ=="> Prof. T.K. Bera's</a> systems and controls research group, as well as <a href="https://med.thapar.edu/facultydetails/MTE5NQ==">Dr. Vishal Gupta's</a> innovative additive manufacturing team. -->

<!-- As a Senior Undergraduate student at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, India, I am majoring in Mechanical Engineering and have been fortunate enough to work in the exciting field of **Robotics & Automation**. Over the past few years, I have been involved in a variety of projects, including the development of autonomous mobile robots, robotic mobile manipulators, application of machine learning and computer vision algorithms on the design and control of various automated/robotic systems. These experiences have allowed me to gain a wealth of knowledge and have fueled my passion for the field.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also had the opportunity to participate in a number of notable events and experiences. During my high school days, I was selected to represent India at the <a href="http://2016.robocup.org/web/index-2.html">International RoboCup Junior</a>, held in **Leipzig, Germany** in 2016. This was a fantastic opportunity to showcase my skills and learn from some of the best and brightest in the field.

During my time at Thapar Institute, I have also been actively involved in various academic and research projects, including internships at **Larsen & Toubro, Heavy Engineering Division** and the **National University of Singapore**. These experiences have allowed me to further develop my skills, and have provided me with valuable insights into the practical applications of my studies.

During my time in Singapore, I had the privilege of working under the mentorship of<a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/ang-jr-marcelo-h/"> Prof. Marcelo H Ang</a> in his research group at the <a href="https://arc.nus.edu.sg/">Advanced Robotics Centre</a>, **National Univeristy of Singapore** from January to June 2022.

In addition to my internships, I have also been involved in research projects at Thapar Institute, with  <a href="https://med.thapar.edu/facultydetails/MTE1NQ=="> Prof. T.K. Bera's</a> systems and controls research group, as well as <a href="https://med.thapar.edu/facultydetails/MTE5NQ==">Dr. Vishal Gupta's</a> innovative additive manufacturing team.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, while staying at home during the lockdown period, I co-founded <a href="https://sites.google.com/thapar.edu/echoestiet/home?authuser=0">Echoes - The Student's Panorama of TIET</a>, the official broadcast media house of Thapar Institute. Through this venture, we produce the official student magazine of the institution, capturing and celebrating university life in all its diverse glamour.

In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I have also been actively involved in community service activities, striving to give back to my community and make a positive impact.

<!-- I am a goal-oriented, determined, hard-working Junior Undergraduate at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, India, pursuing my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. Equipped with technical, analytical, and leadership skills, I'm deeply interested in the field of Robotics and Automation with a demonstrated history in Computer-Aided Design, Control Systems, Rapid Prototyping, and Manufacturing. I believe in learning by doing things. My goal is to take my skills and channel them into a career where I can join my fellow researchers, innovators, engineers to make robots (of any type/any kind) accessible to all by inventing unique solutions for real-world problems. I believe my skills, creativity, and enthusiasm for the field will be assets to any team I join. -->
