The Medical Education Grand Innovation Challenge (MEGIC) is an NUS Medicine initiative to drive innovation in medical education and to create a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. It aims to encourage educators, students and admin staff to identify gaps and opportunities to enhance teaching effectiveness, and to subsequently develop creative solutions.

To train future-ready doctors who can meet the ever-changing healthcare needs of the 21st century, it is important that we continuously seek to raise the standard of medical education. Rapid scientific and technological advances, as well as the development of new models of care delivery, require medical education to evolve as we equip our students with relevant skills, while continuing to nurture core values.

MEGIC serves as a platform to solve the most pressing challenges in medical education and to raise the bar in terms of teaching effectiveness. It aims to encourage educators, students and admin staff to identify gaps and opportunities to enhance learning effectiveness, and subsequently develop creative solutions.
