    Project duration: 2015-2016
    Skills/Tools: Line following, obstacle avoidance, mechanical design, LEGO NXT Mindstorms

**Rescue Line Robot using LEGO NXT Mindstorms**

I consider this project to be another milestone in my career in robotics. The project's main goal was to follow black lines, avoid obstacles, and finally reach an evacuation zone to evacuate victims and place them in a safe area. The competition saw participation from teams across the country, and the winners had the chance of representing India at the International RoboCup Junior to be held in Germany. The robot was flawlessly designed and programmed by my team for this particular task. Being the team leader, I felt fortunate to lift the trophy and had the chance to participate in the International RoboCup Junior in Germany.
