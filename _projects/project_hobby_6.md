Remotely Controlled Ro-Boat
My first-ever personal self-guided project gave a kickstart to my interest in robotics. This Ro-Boat was designed and fabricated for an inter-school Boat Racing Event. I believe my interest in circuits and building things dragged me to participate in this event. As the task was to remote control the boat and finish the fastest, we came up with the idea of using the Rx-Tx circuit of an old RC car. The process was easy; we dismantled the car, used its chip and circuit in the self-designed boat. I guess winning the competition on our first attempt is one of the reasons for pursuing my career in robotics.
