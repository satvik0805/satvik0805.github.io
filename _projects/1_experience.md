    Internship Projects

During the six-month long internship at the Advanced Robotics Centre, I was associated with 2 projects, "Development of an Autonomous Omni-directional Mobile Robot" and "Design and Development of an Automated Eye Kiosk".

The internship was successfully completed under the guidance of Prof. Marcelo H. Ang, Director of the centre and Professor in the department of Mechanical Engineering, NUS.
