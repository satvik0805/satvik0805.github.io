        Echoes ensures to cross the threshold beyond what our eyes can perceive. There are stories hidden in crevices of the world and often in the palm of our hands. We are a group of young and diverse-minded individuals who hope to amplify everything through media. Along with engaging content, we strive to present fresh and authentic news from across the college. However, we do not stop there and take steps to enlighten our audience with the world’s occurrences as well. We envision touching multiple dimensions of journalism, broadcasting, and media coverage, and we aim to do a lot more than just that.

Being The Student’s Panorama of TIET, we strive towards giving the students a holistic experience that encompasses the cultural, technical, sports, and academic aspects of this college. We aim to reflect the spectrum of achievements and activities of our college societies and students, and give updates regarding the college ongoings and upcomings. But to put it all simply, Echoes is a club of the students, by the students, and for the students.

Launched university’s first quarterly official student magazine with a cumulative readership of 10000+ students.

Spearheaded a team of 100+ students to build a platform for the students to preach knowledge and creativity.
