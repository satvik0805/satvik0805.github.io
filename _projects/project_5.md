An ongoing research project in the Department of Mechanical Engineering under the guidance of Dr. Vishal Gupta with his Additive Manufacturing research group.

The primary of this research project is to analyze the mechanical properties of the 3D printed ABS/PLA based parts. The prediction of properties is being done using Machine Learning algorithms using the data as recorded in the test specimen.
