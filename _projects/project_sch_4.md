**Stair Climbing Robot based on the Rocker-bogie Mechanism**
This Robot was designed and fabricated for a senior secondary level school competition. The main objective of the competition was to make the Robot move through various obstructions in the path, including staircase steps, pebbles, mud, etc. Due to the given problem statement, we used the Rocker-Bogie Mechanism for the Robot. The winner was decided on the basis of the time taken to complete the given path.
