Our proposed project is to a one-stop portable interactive kiosk for low cost fully automated comprehensive ophthalmic screening and tele-counselling in the community. When installed at public areas it will be accessible as and when patients require an eye check-up and counselling, instead of eye screening camps which are organised at the convenience of providers. The project seeks to expand the current health system capacity to provide basic population eye screening.

Seamless linkage with Telemedicine System: Allows option for the patient to share their eye scans and test results for grading and subsequently consult directly with doctors directly from the kiosk or using their mobile / pc later from the comfort of their home and at their convenient times. Alternatively, it will suggest nearest clinics where the treatment could be availed.

Primary Objective: To facilitate early diagnosis of the potential causes of reversible blindness in the community by use of screening technology through this automated kiosk, while also reducing dependency on manpower resources in tertiary eye care facilities in Singapore by building and implement in a digital and hardware hybrid solution for fully automated low-cost population eye screening in the community.
