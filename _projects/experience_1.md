    Internship Project: IoT enabled welding stations

Apart from my day to day activities, I was responsible for curating a study project report on IoT enabled welding stations. Since, L&T, Heavy Engineering has also IoTised all their head welding stations with a single worker in a booth controlling multiple welding stations. These initiatives in welding and overlay operations have not only delivered huge productivity improvements but have also enhanced the safety of workers.

I interned as a summer project intern at Larsen & Toubro Ltd., Heavy Engineering Division, Hazira, one of the best manufacturing facilities in the world. While working as an intern, I was responsible for the design and analysis of various machine parts. The main project in which I was involved was in the design and development of an automatic cutting mechanism for the feeded strip in electro slag strip cladding (ESSC) welding process.
