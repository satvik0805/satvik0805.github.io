L&T’s Hazira campus (A. M. Naik Heavy Engineering Complex) is a multi-facility campus that covers a Modular Fabrication Facility (MFF), as well as Heavy Engineering, Defence & Shipbuilding, and Power equipment manufacturing facilities. This modern, coastal complex is situated on a vast plot near Surat in Gujarat. The factory buildings cover over 34,500 sq. m. and the complex has a load-out quay on the banks of the river Tapi close to the Arabian Sea.

Hazira campus is equipped to manufacture extra-large and very heavy equipment for power projects, chemical, refinery, petrochemical & fertilizer industries, which can be shipped out via waterways.

The Modular Fabrication Facility (MFF) at Hazira, one of the largest of its kind in South Asia, is capable of manufacturing several large modules simultaneously with an annual fabrication capacity of 50,000 MT.

In addition, L&T’s Hazira complex has one of the world’s largest Forging facilities, large scale Material handling capabilities, a roll-on-roll-off slipway, and a Shipbuilding facility for high-tech vessels.

The latest addition in the Hazira Manufacturing Complex is the Armoured Systems Complex (ASC) which is a 50 acre, green-field state-of-the-art manufacturing facility created to manufacture, integrate and test advanced Military Armoured Platforms such as Self-propelled Howitzers, Air-defence Systems, Infantry Combat Vehicles, Future-ready Combat Vehicles and Battle Tanks.

This newly established & ultra-modern complex comprises of 320-meter-long workshops with 30 meter and 15 meter bays with in-house advanced Robotic Welding Systems, CNC Machining, System Assembly & Integration facilities, Latest digital solutions for project monitoring, Integrated store management systems, Advanced metrology and a Special Purpose Mobility Test Track facility to roll out fully integrated Armoured systems from ‘plate-to-platform’ basis under a single roof of the complex.

The full-fledged mobility test track, specially designed for rigorous testing, acceptance and qualification of armoured systems, ensures that every equipment delivered meets the most stringent quality standard and is battle worthy across terrains.

ASC has successfully executed an order for supply of 100 Nos. K9 Vajra-T 155 mm 52 calibre Tracked Self Propelled Howitzers for the Indian Armed forces and delivered them well ahead of contractual deliveries.

L&T Defence Unit at Hazira also manufactures Underwater Platforms, Bridging Systems, Missile Launching Systems and various other equipment for Land & Naval forces.

Apart from my day to day activities, I was also responsible for curating a study project report on IoT enabled welding stations. Since, L&T, Heavy Engineering has also IoTised all their head welding stations with a single worker in a booth controlling multiple welding stations. These initiatives in welding and overlay operations have not only delivered huge productivity improvements but have also enhanced the safety of workers.

I interned as a summer project intern at Larsen & Toubro Ltd., Heavy Engineering Division, Hazira, one of the best manufacturing facilities in the world. While working as an intern, I was responsible for the design and analysis of various machine parts. The main project in which I was involved was in the design and development of an automatic cutting mechanism for the feeded strip in electro slag strip cladding (ESSC) welding process.
