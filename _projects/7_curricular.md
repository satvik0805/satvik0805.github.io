RoboCupJunior (RCJ) is one of the best International competitions. It is a division of Robocup organization (http://www.robocup.org/). It focuses on education and aims to introduce the larger goals of the RoboCup project (creating robots) to primary and secondary school students (technically up to age 19). The first international RoboCupJunior competition was held in Melbourne, Australia in 2000. Since then, it has been held in different countries every year. In 2014, it was held in Brazil, 2015 in China and in 2016 it was held in Germany.

The Indian competitions will be held at Regional, Zonal and at National level. The regional competitions will be held in various cities and later the Zonal competitions will be held at 4 zones, namely, South, North, East and West.

Leading the team from the Army Public School, Dhaula Kuan, we participated in the RoboCup Rescue Line League. The North Zone competition was held in Delhi in 2015, the team secured the runner's up spot. Moving ahead to the next stage of the competition, team "APS Sentinels", participated in the National Level where teams from all over India competed to win the championship. Again bagging the second position, the team had the privilege of representing India at the International RoboCup Junior to be held in Germany in 2016.
