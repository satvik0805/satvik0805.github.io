Rescue Robot, RoboCup Rescue Line League
This rescue robot was designed to compete in the International RoboCup Junior held in 2016 in Leipzig, Germany. The robot had to follow black lines, avoid obstacles, and finally evacuate victims and place them in a safe area. The rescue mechanism (arm) of the robot was designed and programmed in such a way as to rescue maximum victims in the least possible time with utmost accuracy and precision.
