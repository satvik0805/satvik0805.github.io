-	Designed and developed a state-of-the-art 6-DOF robot, incorporating advanced kinematics and control algorithms to achieve precise and efficient movement in multiple axes.
-	CAD designed a 6-degree-freedom mobile robotic manipulator for 3D printing using concrete.
-	Utilized CAD (SolidWorks) to create detailed 3D models of the robot, enabling visualization and simulation of its movements & interactions in virtual environments including production drawings.
-	Conducted thorough research & analysis to determine the optimal mechanical design, selecting materials, components, and actuators to ensure robustness, stability, and high performance of the robot.
-	Implemented innovative solutions for the robot's control system, integrating sensors and actuators to enable real-time feedback and closed-loop control, resulting in improved accuracy and repeatability.
-	Conducted extensive testing & validation of the robot's mechanical & electronic systems, ensuring compliance with safety standards and addressing any issues to optimize performance and reliability.
